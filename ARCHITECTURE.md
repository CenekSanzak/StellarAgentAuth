# Architecture

This project lets a wallet owner give an AI agent limited permission to use funds on Stellar. The owner keeps control of the wallet, while the agent can perform only the actions the owner has approved.

**Current status:** The repository contains folders, package configuration, and placeholder modules. The behavior below is the planned design; contracts and services are not implemented or deployed yet.

## Example: paying for services

An agent buys data or API access from providers approved by its owner. The owner deposits funds and permits payments of up to **5 USDC each and 20 USDC per day for seven days**. The agent signs each request; the wallet checks verification and permissions before paying.

A payment of 3 USDC to an approved provider succeeds if enough daily budget remains. A payment of 6 USDC, a payment to an unknown recipient, or any request after confirmed revocation fails. The testnet demo uses a clearly identified test asset to reproduce this flow.

## Design overview

The system separates two decisions: whether an agent has passed verification, and whether a particular action is allowed. Passing verification does not give an agent permission to spend.

Agent controller → Agent registry → Verification service
                                            ↓
                                    Verification registry
                                            ↑
Wallet owner → Approve policy → Smart wallet ← Signed agent action
                                    ↓
                           Approved asset or contract
                                    ↓
                            Events → History service
```

The agent controller manages the agent's identity. The wallet owner controls the funds and permissions. These may be different people.

The design draws from [ERC-8126](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8126) for agent verification and [ERC-8196](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8196) for policy-based execution. It adapts their concepts to Stellar rather than copying Ethereum interfaces. The first release covers a subset of their features and does not claim full ERC compatibility.

## Components and responsibilities

Contracts are planned in Rust with Soroban. The SDK, services, CLI, and demo use TypeScript.

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `contracts/agent-registry` | Store agent identities, signing addresses, and metadata references. |
| `contracts/verification-registry` | Store authenticated provider results and their validity. |
| `contracts/smart-wallet` | Hold funds, enforce policies, execute actions, and record events. |
| `contracts/shared-types` | Define common identity, policy, verification, and error types. |
| `contracts/demo-service` | Provide one restricted contract integration for the demo. |
| `services/verifier` | Read agent metadata, run checks, and publish results. |
| `services/submitter` | Simulate transactions, submit them, and track their status. |
| `services/indexer` | Read events and build a searchable audit history. |
| `packages/sdk` | Provide reusable clients for these workflows. |
| `packages/cli` and `apps/demo` | Let developers and owners interact with the system. |

Policy checks remain inside the wallet contract. This keeps permission checks, spending counters, and fund movements in the same transaction.

## Agent identity and verification

The controller registers an agent ID, signing address, and metadata URI with a content hash. The verifier fetches the registered metadata and checks that its content matches the hash. Changing the signing key or metadata creates a new identity revision, requiring fresh verification and owner permission.

[ERC-8126](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8126) describes off-chain checks covering token, media, code, web, and wallet risks, using metadata resolved from an ERC-8004 identity. Its overall risk score is the mean of applicable check scores, from 0 to 100; lower means lower risk. Our adaptation uses a Stellar registry and documents the corresponding checks and any gaps.

Verification has three distinct meanings here:

| Evidence | What it establishes | What it does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent signature | Control of the registered signing key for the request. | Correct decisions or a trustworthy host. |
| Provider assessment | Findings from the stated checks at a particular time. | Guaranteed future behavior or coverage of unperformed checks. |
| Wallet policy check | Whether the exact action satisfies current permissions and verification requirements. | Whether the action is useful or wise. |

A result records each check as passed, failed, inconclusive, or not applicable. Unsupported checks are identified separately and never counted as passes. Missing or inconclusive required checks deny execution. The implementation mapping will explain how Ethereum-specific token and code checks are adapted to Stellar.

The verifier publishes a result containing the agent ID and revision, provider, completed checks, risk score, evidence hash, issue time, expiry, and revocation status. Detailed reports stay off-chain. An evidence hash links a result to a report; it is not a zero-knowledge proof.

Each policy names a provider the owner trusts. Before every action, the wallet reads that provider's latest result. Missing, expired, revoked, or failed required checks block execution. A newer failure cannot be replaced with an older passing result. Serious wallet-risk flags also block execution regardless of the average score.

## Wallet and permissions

The owner deposits supported assets into a separate wallet contract. The agent receives no signing authority over the owner's ordinary Stellar account and never needs the owner's private key.

A policy defines:

- **Who:** agent ID, identity revision, and signing address.
- **Verification:** trusted provider, required checks, maximum result age, and maximum risk score.
- **Actions:** allowed assets, methods, contracts, and recipients, with explicit blocked targets.
- **Limits:** per-transaction and daily spending caps for each asset.
- **Lifetime:** activation time, expiry, and revocation status.

The risk threshold is called `max_risk_score`. This preserves ERC-8196's rule that scores above the policy threshold are rejected.

Amounts use integer asset units, and assets are identified by contract address. Daily budgets reset at midnight UTC using ledger time. Each policy has its own budget, so the owner interface must show the combined exposure when approving several policies.

Only the owner can approve or revoke policies, pause agent access, or withdraw funds. Permission changes require replacing a policy. Empty allowlists permit nothing, and explicit blocks take priority.

## How an action executes

1. The agent prepares an action with the wallet address, policy hash, action details, deadline, and next policy sequence number. For a transfer, the details include the asset, recipient, and amount.
2. The SDK prepares authorization for that exact request. The agent signs it, and a submitter may pay the transaction fee. Paying the fee gives the submitter no spending authority.
3. The wallet authenticates the agent and checks that the policy is active, the identity revision matches, and the request has not expired or already been used.
4. It reads the current verification result, validates the action, and checks the remaining budget.
5. It advances the sequence number, updates spending counters, and calls the approved asset or contract. Success records an audit event; failure rolls back the action and counters together.

Contract integrations allow specific methods and validated arguments. An approved contract address does not grant unrestricted access to its methods or token approvals. The first release handles one action per request.

Revocation blocks subsequent execution once confirmed on-chain, including requests signed earlier. It cannot undo a completed transfer.

## History, storage, and trust

Successful actions and owner changes emit events. Audit entries include the previous entry's hash, and the wallet stores the latest hash and sequence. The indexer reconstructs this history and can detect missing or altered entries. It has no authority to approve transactions.

Rejected actions are shown through simulation errors or transaction results. Failed transactions do not leave committed wallet events.

Policies, revocations, spending counters, and sequence numbers use persistent storage. Storage maintenance must extend Soroban data lifetimes and handle restoration. Restoring data must preserve spending history and revocation; it must never reactivate an expired policy.

Verification depends on the selected provider and does not guarantee safe behavior. If an agent key is compromised, an attacker may use its remaining permissions. Narrow policies and owner revocation limit that exposure.

## Delivery milestones and acceptance

The [README grant milestones](readme.md#grant-milestones) describe the deliverables. Their technical completion criteria are:

1. **Identity and verification:** Register an agent and publish a provider-authenticated result. Tests reject unauthorized publication, invalidate old identity revisions, and enforce result expiry and revocation. Document supported checks, scoring, and deferred EIP features.
2. **Wallet payments:** Demonstrate a signed permitted transfer. Tests reject invalid signatures, replay, per-payment and daily overspending, unapproved assets and recipients, inactive or expired policies, owner pause, and revoked access. Verification tests reject missing or stale results, excessive risk scores, and serious wallet-risk flags. A failed asset call must roll back counters and balance changes.
3. **SDK and integration:** Run the full workflow through a public SDK example and CLI commands. Demonstrate one restricted service-contract call and rejection of an unsupported method or invalid arguments.
4. **Testnet demo:** Publish deployment IDs, transaction links, setup instructions, and a recording of the payment scenario. Rebuild the audit chain from indexed events and match the wallet's stored hash. Run all automated acceptance checks in CI.

Signed workflow tests belong in `tests/integration`; rejection cases belong in `tests/adversarial`. Public fixtures belong in `tests/fixtures` and must be labelled as simulated assessments. Deployment records belong in `deployments/testnet`.

Privacy proofs, entropy commit-reveal, TLS credential delegation, external identity registry integration, and arbitrary contract execution are outside the first release. Each requires a separate design before implementation.
